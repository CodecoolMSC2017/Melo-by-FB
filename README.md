# Melo-by-FB

## The MeLo application supports storing media information to your hard drive. The application is configurable to watch folders and collect media files. Users are able to configure which folders they would like to watch to add files automatically to the MeLo database. You can use a relational database to store information or any file format you want.

During the program's execution when a new media file appears in a watched folder users are automatically notified about it.

The application shows media files in categories. When a user selects a media file from a category group a dialog appears where category specific information can be edited.

Category specific information are: audio file tags, viewing options for videos or listening options for audio files.

For mp3 files there are specific options: users can create albums (by selecting multiple mp3 files). For each selected mp3 file the "album name" tag is automatically updated according to the user input. Users are also able to split mp3 files into multiple pieces or concatenate multiple files into a single mp3.

All configuration settings are modifiable via the application.
